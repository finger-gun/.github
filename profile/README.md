# 🔫 Finger Gun

*A studio for side quests, half-baked genius, and dangerously playful ideas.*

We specialize in things no one asked for but might love anyway.  
From AI photo hunts to mood-based UI glitches, we build weirdly useful stuff at the intersection of creativity, code, and questionable decision-making.

Fueled by **vibe coding**, last-minute refactors, and the occasional “why is this working?”, we ship first and understand later. Mostly.
