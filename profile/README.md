# 🔫 Finger Gun

*A studio for side quests, half-baked genius, and dangerously playful ideas.*

We specialize in things no one asked for but might love anyway.  
From AI photo hunts to mood-based UI glitches, we build weirdly useful stuff at the intersection of creativity, code, and questionable decision-making.

Fueled by **vibe coding**, last-minute refactors, and the occasional “why is this working?”, we ship first and understand later. Mostly.

### [sisu](https://github.com/Finger-Gun/sisu) — Grit-powered agents. Quiet, determined, relentlessly useful.

Sisu is a lightweight TypeScript framework for turning intent into action. Inspired by the Finnish idea of *sisu*—calm resolve under pressure—Sisu favors explicit tools, predictable plans, and built-in guardrails. No ceremony, no mystery: compose, decide, do.

### [Reframe](https://github.com/Finger-Gun/Reframe)* — Your city just became a photo quest.

Reframe is a photo discovery game that turns your city into a playground of visual challenges. Players receive image-based quests to find and re-capture real-world scenes. With AI-powered visual similarity, Reframe rewards accurate framing and composition.

_*Unfortunately private for now, and not released yet. Stay tuned._*

### [Dragonbane Unbound](https://github.com/finger-gun/dragonbane-unbound) — Tabletop chaos, unchained.

An experimental playground for Dragonbane-inspired mechanics, tools, or digital companions. Equal parts homage and hacking ground, Dragonbane Unbound explores what happens when classic fantasy systems meet modern tooling and unapologetic tinkering.

### [Linopress](https://github.com/finger-gun/linopress) — Publish first. Refactor later.

Linopress is a lightweight publishing experiment focused on frictionless writing and fast iteration. Minimal structure, maximal momentum—because sometimes the best CMS is just enough CMS.

### [Homunculus](https://github.com/finger-gun/homunculus)* — Small creature. Big intentions.

Homunculus is a private experiment in building compact, opinionated systems that punch above their weight. Part automation gremlin, part idea incubator. Details are scarce. That’s intentional.

_*Currently private._*
