# 🔫 Finger Gun

*A studio for side quests, half-baked genius, and dangerously playful ideas.*

We specialize in things no one asked for but might love anyway.  
From AI photo hunts to mood-based UI glitches, we build weirdly useful stuff at the intersection of creativity, code, and questionable decision-making.

Fueled by **vibe coding**, last-minute refactors, and the occasional “why is this working?”, we ship first and understand later. Mostly.

Give it a prompt and it provisions an isolated WordPress sandbox, generates themes, pages, and plugins using deterministic tools and skills, validates the result with an agent-driven browser, self-heals on failure, and produces a portable deploy bundle.

From idea to verified site — automated, reproducible, and ready to ship.

Homunculus is an **Invisible HUD** for TTRPGs designed to destroy the screen barrier. It’s a zero-click augmentation tool that listens to your session and provides instant rule lookups and campaign context drawn from your own notes.

Not an AI GM or DM — but a dedicated librarian and chronicler.  
Homunculus keeps the rules and history at your fingertips so you can keep your eyes on the players, not the screen.
